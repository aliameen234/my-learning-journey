I learnt some commands in cmd and github:
    1: GUI- graphical user interface. //this is not a command.
    2: dir/ls- it lists all the directories.
    3: cls/clear: it clears the screen. //CLS isn't accepted by github.
    4: md/mkdir: this creates a directory. //MD isn't accepted by github.
    5: ren/mv: this renames a directory. //REN isn't accepted by github.
    6: rmdir: this removes a directory.
    7: touch: this creates a text file. (bash command)
    8. code .: this command opens the current dir/folder in visual studio code.

    However directories is also the same as folder. So when you hear directory it means folder.
