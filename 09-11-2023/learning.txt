i read logic building and effective problem solving textbook: 
    1. i read about the i.p.o cycle
    2. i read about programs and programming language:
        1. sequential: instructions that are executed one after the other.
        2. Decision making: instructions that evaluate an expression (relation or condition) first and then, depending upon
                            whether the value of the expression is true or false, the control is transferred to a particular
                            statement.
        3. Iterative: instructions that are executed repeatedly, depending upon the value of an expression (relation or condition)
    3. compiler: a compiler is a special program that processes the statements written in a particular programming language
                 and converts them into machine language, at oe go.
