what i learned on monday:
    1: how to use variables and constant


    1: A variable refers to the memory location that can store only one value at a time but can vary throughout the program execution.
    2: A constant refers to a memory location that holds a value, which remains fixed throughout the program execution.

    THEN WE DID AN EXAMPLE:
    -QUESTION you have to write a pseudocode that accepts two numbers and display their sum abd product 
    -ANSWER begin
            numeric nNum1,nNum2,nProduct
            display "Enter a number"
            accept nNum1
            display "Enter another number"
            accept nNum2
            nProduct = nNum1*nNum2
            display nProduct
            end
