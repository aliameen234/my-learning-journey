what i learnt on wednesday:
    1: we learnt the rules for creating flowchart
    2: the teacher explained some things about pseudocode to us and we did some classwork:

    -QUESTION: Draw a simple flowchart to accept the principle,rate and times value and display the simple interest.
    -ANSWER:    begin
                Numeric p,r,t,si
                Display 'Enter the principal amount'
                Accept p
                Display 'Enter the rate'
                Accept r
                Display 'Enter period of time'
                Accept t
                si = (p*r*t)/100
                Display si
                end

    -QUESTION: Draw a flowchart that accepts the length and breadth of a rectangle and displays its area and perimeter
    -ANSWER:    begin
                Numeric l,b,a,p
                Accept l,b
                a=l*b
                p=2*(l+b)
                Display 'a'+p
                end
