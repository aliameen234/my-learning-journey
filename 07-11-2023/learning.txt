what i learnt on tuesday:
    1. I read about scratch:
        scratch is a software that was designed specifically for creating pseudocode.
    2. i downloaded it from "http:/info.scratch.mit.edu/scratch_1.4_Download"
    3. i installed it on my laptop
    4. then i went through some other definition:
            Scratch can be used for creating small programs/pseudocode, animation and games.
    5. i read about the scratch interface various buttons:
        Motion
        Looks
        Sound
        Pen
        Control
        Sensing
        Operators
        Variables
        The scratch interface provides the following tabs for the creation of programs/pseudocode:
        Scripts
        Costumes
        Sounds
        In addition the scratch interface contains the following panes:
        Output pane 
        New sprite pane
    6. i read the steps on how to create a pseudocode:
        To create a pseudocode, you need to drag the required structures from the "structures pane" and then, drag them
        in the Scripts tab. After dragging the required structures and connecting them together to form a pseudocode, you 
        can execute it and verify the Output in the Output pane
