what i learnt on monday:
    1: the tools that you can use to represent the procedure to solve a problem are:
        *Algorithm
        *flowchart
        *pseudocode

        -An algorithm is a sequence of steps required to solve a problem
        "I ALSO LEARNED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ALGORITHM".

        -A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm
        -It consist of a set of symbol, where each symbol represents a specific kind of activity depicted in the algorithm
        "ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF A FLOWCHART"

        -A pseudocode is a yet readable description of what an algorithm must do
        -Expressed in a formally styled natural language rather than in a programming language
        -Used as an initial step in the process of developing a program
