what i learned on tuesday:
    1: identify data types

    Data types can be broadly categorized in the following types:
    1. Numeric
    2. Character

    A variable should be declared along with data type
    The data type specifies the type of value to be stored by the variable
    Each data type allocates a fixed amount of memory space, according to the programming language specification
    It is essential to declare a variable so that memory is allocated for a value before it is used in program
    While naming a variable, the following rules must be followed:
        it can consist of letters (uppercase has well lowercase), digit, or underscore
        it must begin with a letter or an underscore
        it must not contain any embedded space and symbol, such as: ?,!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,(),{},[],.,:,;,"",'',/,\,.
